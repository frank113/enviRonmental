## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Functions

+ New Environment Wrapper
+ Add to Environment
+ Remove from Environment
+ Call from Environment (without loading the function)
+ Load from Environment (copy data from one envir to other)
+ Load as global (import all objs into global)
+ Switch (x <--> y)
+ Load environment from file


# Notes

loadNamespace() loads an environment

THINKING: Multiple windows open -- hard to keep track of. When you load a project you load the environment and associate each with an environment (or session) that includes pacakges, etc.
